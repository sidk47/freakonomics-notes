Day care in Haifa, Israel

EXAMPLES OF INCENTIVES
----------------------
burn finger on induction stove
eat vegetables for one week - go to toy shop
straight As from school - new bike
pick your nose - ridiculed
make it to the basketball team - move up the social ladder
break curfew - grounded
ace your sat - good college
flunk law school - work in your father's insurance company
do so well that a rival company comes calling - no longer have to work under your father as you are promoted to vice president
if you get excited about the promotion and drive home too fast - fined a 100 bucks for speeding
but if you do so well as to collect a year end bonus you don't care and can buy a comprehensive induction stove range that your daughter can burn her finger on.

An incentive is simply the way to get a human to do more of a good thing and less of a bad thing.
